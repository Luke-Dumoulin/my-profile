				  	<h2>Tennis</h2>
				  	<p>Tennis is something I hold very close to my heart. Iâ€™ve played it since I was 3-4 years old and have developed a fairly high skill level. I play tournaments back in Canada where I live and often meet up with friends in order to play tennis. So, tennis entertains a hobby as well as friendships.

				  	<h2>Badminton</h2>
				  	<p>Badminton is a sport I picked up because of Covid-19. We were stuck at home, so my parents bought one of the lawn badminton nets. My neighbourhood friends and my brothers spent all day playing badminton. Later I joined a club and got pretty decent at it since I have some tennis skills to fall back on.

				  	<h2>Mountain Biking</h2>
				  	<p>Mountain biking, or biking in mountains, holds a special place in my heart. Every year in summer we go to the Alps and do a couple climbs up a mountain, a task full of perseverance and grit. Once at the top, we return the road bikes and rent out downhill mountain bikes, and he take some incredible rides. Whatever adrenaline is lacking on the way up is made up for on the way down.

				  	<h2>Skiing</h2>
				  	<p>Wilderness skiing is something I picked up in the last couple years when we were lucky enough to ski in the Alps during winter. Our instructor deemed that we were good enough to ski in the wilderness, and it is unlike anything else. The sensations are incredible!
